# Question 1

(a) **Let X be a random variable with mean 0 and finite variance $\sigma^2$. By applying Markovâ€™s inequality to the random variable $W = (X+t)^2$, where $t > 0$, show that**

\begin{equation*}
P(X>a) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2+a^2}\;\;\text{ \textbf{for any $a>0$.}}
\end{equation*}
